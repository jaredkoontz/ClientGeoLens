RoadMap of To do:

client
-rectangles mapped with histograms
-check browser types
-make histograms use new data
-figure out where to put geohash values/colors.


server
-Make server code use json
-Make server repository on github (this involves combinging code into my own galileo dir)




Thoughts
hard code wanted features
what to do about wanted time frame of query? hardcode?
when to compute average?

--beforehand -> first



make histograms vertical?

json structure
-root
  -geohashRectangleCoords
  -Yearhists?
    -monthhists
      -dayhists

Where to put values?
  each level?
  at day and sum up?
    probably want to sum up at each level.




--bin on time dimension
    put all jan in one
    put all feb in one
