todo add button to enable multiple resolution
todo remove drawing toolbar on pre computed examples.


MAJOR BUGS
Histograms sometimes lexicographically sorted, not sorted by value

Fast And Easy to do
todo "instant click" if on 2014 march and then want to look at 2013, you need to click on 2013 twice.
todo make the geohash text value appear on mouse over.
todo comment code and make set Data a smaller function. Reduce number of global functions?
todo comment code


-bugs
todo max color is not shown on lowest histogram
sometimes top number is not shown

main functionality left to do:
todo brushing and linking from hists to geohashes
    todo from geohashes to hist -> show bar with closest color/samecolor
    todo from hist to geohashes -> all hashes with the same color.



---------------
todo make poly buttons grey after drawing query
todo image tile cache
todo edit control is actually quite useful
todo minify javascript

---------------


image tiles cache, sometimes it goes down.

//could have numcolors in histogram, and set geohashes accordingly. Would make brushing and linking very easy.
//currently using 8 colors.




RoadMap of To do:
-----
client
-rectangles mapped with histograms
-check browser types
-make histograms use new data
-figure out where to put geohash values/colors.


server
-Make server code use json
-Make server repository on github (this involves combinging code into my own galileo dir)




Thoughts
hard code wanted features
what to do about wanted time frame of query? hardcode?
when to compute average?

--beforehand -> first
