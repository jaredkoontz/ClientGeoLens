todo icon/logo
todo make sprite sheet smaller
todo make poly buttons grey after drawing query
todo put hist on map because it is easier on mobile?

--hard to do



---------------


RoadMap of To do:

-Change functionality of pushing send query to actually send query
-Make map still work when histograms are still on them? Could do state machine.
-Make server code use json
-Make server repository on github (this involves combinging code into my own galileo dir)
-check browser types
