todo icon/logo
todo make poly buttons grey after drawing query

RoadMap of To do:

-Change functionality of pushing send query to actually send query
-Make map still work when histograms are still on them? Could do state machine.
-Make server code use json
-Make server repository on github (this involves combinging code into my own galileo dir)
-check browser types
