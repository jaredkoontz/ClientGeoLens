Fast And Easy to do
todo "instant click" if on 2014 march and then want to look at 2013, you need to click on 2013 twice.
todo make the geohash text value appear on mouse over.
todo comment code and make set Data a smaller function. Reduce number of global functions?

-bugs
todo max color is not shown on lowest histogram

main functionality left to do:
todo else brance of merging histograms/when histograms are not in the next immediate child
todo brushing and linking from hists to geohashes

todo from geohashes to hist -> show bar with closest color/samecolor
todo from hist to geohashes -> all hashes with the same color.



---------------
todo make poly buttons grey after drawing query
todo image tile cache
todo edit control is actually quite useful
todo minify javascript

---------------


RoadMap of To do:
-----
client
-rectangles mapped with histograms
-check browser types
-make histograms use new data
-figure out where to put geohash values/colors.


server
-Make server code use json
-Make server repository on github (this involves combinging code into my own galileo dir)




Thoughts
hard code wanted features
what to do about wanted time frame of query? hardcode?
when to compute average?

--beforehand -> first



make histograms vertical?

json structure
-root
  -geohashRectangleCoords
  -Yearhists?
    -monthhists
      -dayhists

Where to put values?
  each level?
  at day and sum up?
    probably want to sum up at each level.




--bin on time dimension
    put all jan in one
    put all feb in one
