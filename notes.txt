---------------
todo make poly buttons grey after drawing query
todo image tile cache
todo multiple histograms on panel.
todo edit control is actually quite useful
todo minify javascript
---------------


RoadMap of To do:
-rectangles mapped with histograms
-Make server code use json
-Make server repository on github (this involves combinging code into my own galileo dir)
-check browser types



Thoughts
hard code wanted features
what to do about wanted time frame of query? hardcode?

make histograms vertical?

json structure
-root
  -geohashRectangleCoords
  -Yearhists?
    -monthhists
      -dayhists

Where to put values?
  each level?
  at day and sum up?
    probably want to sum up at each level.




--bin on time dimension
    put all jan in one
    put all feb in one
